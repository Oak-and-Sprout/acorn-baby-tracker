# Multi-Family Support Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding multi-family support to the baby tracking application. The goal is to allow multiple families to use the application with separate URLs, babies, and caretakers.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

### 1.1 Create Family Model
```prisma
model Family {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  slug      String   @unique
  name      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  babies     Baby[]
  caretakers Caretaker[]
  settings   Settings[]
  // Add other relations as needed
}
```

### 1.2 Update Existing Models
- Add `familyId` field to all relevant models
- Make `familyId` required for most models
- Set up proper relations
- Add indexes for better query performance

### 1.3 Migration Strategy
- Create migration script to:
  - Add Family model
  - Add familyId to all models
  - Create default family for existing users
  - Generate slugs for all families
  - Assign all existing data to default family

## Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Update Auth Flow
- Modify login to handle family selection
- Store selected familyId in session/token
- Update auth context to include family information

### 2.2 Update Middleware
- Add family-based access control
- Verify user has access to requested family
- Handle unauthorized access gracefully

## Phase 3: API Routes

### 3.1 Update Existing Endpoints
- Add family-based filtering to all GET endpoints
- Update input validation to include familyId
- Modify responses to be family-scoped
- Add proper error handling

### 3.2 New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/families` - List all families for current user
- `POST /api/families` - Create new family
- `GET /api/families/[slug]` - Get family details
- `PATCH /api/families/[slug]` - Update family
- `DELETE /api/families/[slug]` - Delete family
- `POST /api/families/[slug]/invite` - Invite new members
- `POST /api/families/[slug]/leave` - Leave family

## Phase 4: Frontend Changes

### 4.1 App Layout
- Add family switcher in header
- Update navigation to include family slug in routes
- Add loading states

### 4.2 Routes
- Update all routes to include `[familySlug]` parameter
- Update all data-fetching to include family context
- Handle 404 for invalid family slugs

### 4.3 Settings
- Add family management section
- Allow editing family name and slug
- Show current family members
- Invite new members
- Leave family option

## Phase 5: Data Migration

### 5.1 Migration Script
- Create default family for existing users
- Generate slugs for all families
- Assign all existing data to default family
- Validate data integrity

### 5.2 Testing
- Test migration on staging with production data
- Create rollback plan
- Schedule maintenance window if needed

## Implementation Order

1. **Database Changes**
   - Add Family model
   - Add familyId to existing models
   - Create migration

2. **Auth & Middleware**
   - Update auth context
   - Add family-based access control

3. **API Updates**
   - Update read endpoints
   - Update write endpoints
   - Add family management endpoints

4. **Frontend Updates**
   - Update routing
   - Add family switcher
   - Update data fetching
   - Add family management UI

5. **Data Migration**
   - Test migration
   - Execute production migration
   - Verify data integrity

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all new utility functions
   - Test API endpoints

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test family-based access control
   - Test data isolation between families

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Test family management features

## Rollout Plan

1. Deploy to staging for testing
2. Test all critical paths
3. Deploy to production with feature flag
4. Enable for beta testers
5. Monitor for issues
6. Roll out to all users

## Future Enhancements

1. Family member roles (admin, member, etc.)
2. Family activity feed
3. Family usage analytics
4. Family-specific settings
5. Family data export

## Risks & Mitigations

1. **Performance Impact**
   - Add proper indexing
   - Monitor query performance

2. **Data Migration**
   - Backup before migration
   - Test migration thoroughly

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear feedback
   - Add loading states
   - Handle errors gracefully
