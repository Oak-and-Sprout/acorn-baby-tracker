- Displays events in a scrollable list
- Includes an "Add Event" button
- Handles loading and empty states
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Dark mode support
- Accessible UI with proper semantic structure

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { CalendarDayView } from '@/src/components/CalendarDayView';

function CalendarPage() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(new Date());
  const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleEventClick = (event) => {
    // Open event details
    openEventDetails(event);
  };
  
  const handleAddEvent = (date) => {
    // Open form to add new event
    openAddEventForm(date);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
      <Calendar 
        onDateSelect={setSelectedDate}
        // other props
      />
      
      <CalendarDayView
        date={selectedDate}
        events={events}
        onEventClick={handleEventClick}
        onAddEvent={handleAddEvent}
        isLoading={isLoading}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Component API

### CalendarDayView

Main component for displaying events for a selected day.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| `date` | `Date` | The selected date to display events for | Required |
| `events` | `CalendarEventData[]` | Array of events for the selected date | Required |
| `onEventClick` | `(event: CalendarEventData) => void` | Handler for when an event is clicked | `undefined` |
| `onAddEvent` | `(date: Date) => void` | Handler for when the add event button is clicked | `undefined` |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | Whether the component is in a loading state | `false` |
| `className` | `string` | Additional CSS classes to apply | `undefined` |

## Visual Behavior

The component has three main states:

### Loading State
- Displays a loading spinner
- Shows the selected date in the header

### Empty State
- Displays a message indicating no events for the selected day
- Shows an "Add Event" button if `onAddEvent` is provided

### Events State
- Groups events by time of day:
  - Morning (12am - 11:59am)
  - Afternoon (12pm - 4:59pm)
  - Evening (5pm - 11:59pm)
- Each group has an icon and title
- Events are displayed using the `CalendarEventItem` component
- Events are sorted by start time within each group
- Shows an "Add Event" button if `onAddEvent` is provided

## Implementation Details

The component is built using:
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- CSS modules for component-specific styles

The component follows a modular structure:
- `index.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `calendar-day-view.styles.ts` - Style definitions using Tailwind CSS
- `calendar-day-view.types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `calendar-day-view.css` - Additional CSS for dark mode and animations

## Accessibility

The component includes:
- Proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading levels
- ARIA labels for buttons
- Keyboard navigable interactive elements
- Color contrast that meets WCAG guidelines
- Focus states for interactive elements

## Cross-Platform Considerations

This component is designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind:

- Uses standard React patterns that can be adapted to React Native
- Avoids web-specific APIs (except for custom scrollbar styling, which can be omitted in React Native)
- Uses relative sizing that can be adapted to different screen sizes
- Implements touch-friendly button sizes
- Separates styling from component logic for easier platform adaptation

When converting to React Native, the styling would need to be adapted to use React Native's StyleSheet or a compatible styling solution like NativeWind. The scrollable container would need to be implemented using React Native's ScrollView component.
